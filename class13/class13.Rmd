## Get HIV-Pr structure from PDB database

We will work with the struture 1HSG

```{r}
library(bio3d)
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```

Read this into R and examine composition

```{r}
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)
hiv
```

Question 1: The ligand is MK1 and the second nonprotein residue is HOH

## Prepare initial protein and ligand input files

Split into protein only and a ligand only

We will use the `trim.pdb()` function to split our input structure

```{r}
prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
prot
```

Write out a new protein-only pdb file

```{r}
write.pdb(prot, file = "1hsg_protein.pdb")
```

Do the same for ligand-only

```{r}
lig <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
lig
write.pdb(lig, file = "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```
